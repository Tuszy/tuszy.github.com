    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>That was sure a very busy weekend. I had an opportunity to participate
as a speaker in Cracow.mobi conference. The subject of my talk was Data Persistance
in iOS. I tried to make it attractive both for beginners by starting the
presentation with NSUserDefaults and not to bore some experienced folks with
diving into Core Data and iCloud. The whole presentation is available for
you to download from slideshare @ slidesha.re/vGHDza. All the code samples are
also available in GitHub (links in the last slide of the presentation).</p>

<p>I'd like to thank the organizers for such an awesome event. I met a lot of
interesting people and got a chance to listen to interesting topics from other
speakers. It's good that there is more buzz around mobile topics lately in Poland.</p>
